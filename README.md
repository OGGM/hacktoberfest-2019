## What is Hacktoberfest?

Hacktoberfest is a [hack day, hackathon, codefest, hackfest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackathon) 
(name it as you wish) organised in October after the original idea of 
[Digital Ocean](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/). Like last year, it is organised conjointly 
with the Universities of Innsbruck and Bremen, and generously supported by [OGGM e.V.](https://oggm.org/oggmev/).

## How does this work?

It's very simple. Instead of doing what you would do on a usual work day (going to meetings, 
working alone on your computer, look at social media, read the news...), you spend
the day with us and do something fun with code instead!

There are only a few rules this year:
- choose a project that is **not** what you would do anyway on this day (see possible topics below)
- work as a team of 2 or 3! It's much more fun this way
- at the end of the day, each group will have a short "show and tell" to present what they did to the others

## What's the agenda?

**A couple of days before the actual hackathon**, we will have a short (~ 1-2 hours) meeting to discuss about open-source and github (a very short tutorial!) and spend time preparing our projects: who will work on what, etc.

**On hack day**, we meet at 08:00 for breakfast. In the morning, we code. In the afternoon, we code. At the end of the afternoon, we have beers, a short "show and tell", and we order pizzas.

## Will there be food?

Yes! In Innsbruck, we will take care of breakfast, snacks during the day and pizzas + beers for the evening (no proper lunch is planned). In Bremen, we will...

## What project can I work on?

See our [list of projects](https://github.com/OGGM/hacktoberfest-2019/issues) and ask questions / join the discussion!

## I have a project idea! Where can I share it?

See our [list of projects](https://github.com/OGGM/hacktoberfest-2019/issues) and add yours!

## I'm not a hacker / coder / I don't know what to work on / etc.

No worries! We will do our best to create a welcoming atmosphere for 
everyone: we are all here to learn and have fun, that's all!
